# Writing principles

## Every example is real, or it's a liability

An invented code snippet is a promise the docs make on the system's
behalf, unverified. It drifts the moment the real API changes, and
nothing forces anyone to notice. Prefer embedding an actual example from
the real codebase — a real config file, a real test scenario, a real
CLI transcript — over writing one from scratch for the docs. When you
do embed one:

- **Quote it verbatim**, don't "clean it up for readability." A reader
  who copies it should get something that actually works.
- **Name the real source** ("this is the complete, real
  `tests/quickstart_test.py` — nothing here is trimmed for the docs")
  so a skeptical reader can go verify it themselves, and so a future
  editor knows there's a real file to keep in sync.
- When the real example changes, the doc's embedded copy has to change
  with it in the same edit — this doesn't happen automatically, so flag
  it as a linked pair when you first create the embed (a comment in the
  source file pointing at the doc section that quotes it is cheap
  insurance).

## One fact, one home

If two pages both explain what a term means or how a mechanism works,
one of them is already stale and you don't know which. Pick the
authoritative page for each concept, explain it there in full, and
*link* to it from everywhere else instead of re-explaining. A reference
page can use a term without re-deriving it — that's what the concepts
page is for.

## Terminology: match the reader's mental model, not the source code's

Prose describing what something *is* or *does* should read like a
sentence a knowledgeable person would actually say, not a
concatenated-identifier stand-in for it (`the Chart's dependencies`, not
`the HelmChart.dependencies`) — reserve the exact code-identifier
spelling for genuine code references (a function name, a class, a
literal command). When a project has both a user-facing vocabulary and
an internal implementation vocabulary for the same idea, decide
explicitly which one prose uses and hold the line consistently; don't
let the two bleed into each other page by page.

## Write the quick start as if the reader already has a real thing to test

The strongest quick start isn't "install the tool, run `--help`" — it's
"here's the exact, complete, real flow for the most common real task,
narrated as if you already had a system of your own to point it at."
Concretely: frame it in first person around a plausible real scenario
("say you just built X and want to prove it works"), use one of the
project's own real fixtures as the stand-in for the reader's system, and
show the *complete* real artifact (the whole config file, the whole test
scenario) rather than an abbreviated fragment — trimming "for
simplicity" is exactly where invented-example drift starts.

## Don't hide navigation or table-of-contents without a real reason

Per-page front matter that hides the sidebar/TOC (`hide: navigation`,
`hide: toc`) trades a real, persistent cost (every other page on the
site loses its wayfinding while this one is open) for a cosmetic gain
that's rarely worth it outside a genuine full-bleed landing page. If a
page needs it, that's a deliberate design call to make once, not a
default to reach for.

## Abbreviations and jargon: define once, reference everywhere

Material's `abbr` extension (paired with a page-bottom
`*[TERM]: expansion` block) renders a term as a dotted-underline
hover-tooltip everywhere it's used on that page — cheaper than either
spelling it out every time or leaving a reader to guess:

```markdown
Real `BDD`-style scenarios exercise the API.

*[BDD]: Behavior-Driven Development
```

Keep one canonical list of a project's abbreviations (even if it has to
be pasted at the bottom of every page — `mkdocs` has no site-wide abbr
include) so `BDD` means the same thing on every page it appears.
